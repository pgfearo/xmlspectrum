<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>XMLSpectrum-FX is a simple graphical front-end for controlling an XSLT transform that converts XPath and related languages to a form rendered in HTML. The application is coded in Java-FX 2.2</p>
<p><em>The Saxon-HE XSLT 2.0 processor from <a href="http://www.saxonica.com" title="Saxonica">Saxonica</a> is discributed with this application.</em></p>
<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<h5>Installation</h5>
<p>For the latest source file and build, see the <a href="https://github.com/pgfearo/xmlspectrum">GitHub XMLSpectrum project</a>.</p>
<p>From the command-line run <code>java -version </code> to check that you have the latest version of Java installed on your machine - this should be at least Java 1.7.0_07-b11.</p>
<h5>Launch</h5>
<p>Using the command shell of your OS, navigate to the install path and run XMLSpectrum-FX with the following:</p>
<p>
<code><pre style="font-family:monospace;">java -jar XMLSpectrum-FX.jar</pre></code>

</p>
<p>Once launched, you will see the main XMLSpectrum-FX window. This comprises an embedded browser (Webkit) with a vertical control panel to the right of it. Above the browser you will find a text-box; enter the URL or path of a source file here, alternatively, drag-and-drop a local file from your file manager to this location.</p>
<p>With the text-box populated with a valid URL or file-path, press the adjacent <em>Run</em> button. You should now see the source code rendered in the browser view in colorised form and formatted in accordance with the parameter settings in the control panel.</p>
<h5>Using XMLSpectrum-FX</h5>
<p>This product's main use is as a product demonstrator and graphical test-harness for the XMLSpectrum XSLT stylesheets which are really optimised for server-side document-processing. However, it may also prove useful as an ad-hoc tool for preparing XPath/XSLT code snippets ready for publishing on the web.</p>
<h5>Asynchronous Processing</h5>
<p>Large files or projects may take a while to process; to ensure UI responsiveness, all transforms are performed on a separate thread. The XMLSpectrum status bar below the HTML view is updated continusouly to show the progress of a transform </p>

<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>Settings for syntax-coloring and formatting are managed from the 2 vertical panels surrounding the browser view. The following settings are available:</p>
<ul class="square">
<li><strong>Source</strong> Choose whether to use existing a path to an existing file or copy and paste text from an editor.</li>
<li><strong>Font</strong> Switch between Source Code Pro and the default monospaced font.</li>

<li><strong>Color Theme</strong> Select from a range of pre-defined color themes.</li>
<li><strong>Language</strong> For XML-based code snippets or fragments where no XML namespace is available, select the language of the source code as a hint to ensure it is rendered properly.</li>
<li><strong>XSLT Project</strong> For modular XSLT projects: The processor traverses all imported files, creating hyperlinked content for public members and presents a Table of Contents for all files in the project.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-Trim</strong> Removes leading spaces from XML to allow correction of the formatting. Leading spaces are trimmed, not removed entirely, to ensure text indentation is still maintained, but in a way that is consistent with the XML formatting.</li>
<li><strong>Indent</strong> Set the number of characters to indent for each level of XML nesting.</li>
<li><strong>Force NewLines</strong> Switch this on if the source XML has no existing linefeeds between elements. Linefeeds are inserted except where mixed-content is detected.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong> Select links to the documentation (this file) and bundled sample code for rendering in the browser.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Support</h3>
<p>Please contact <a href="mailto:support@qutoric.com">support@qutoric.com</a> with any issues, queries or feature requests, I will do my best to give a timely reply but please bear in mind that this is a 'spare-time' project so there may be other priorities.</p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>This product was developed by Phil Fearon, it is free and requires no registration. The XMLSpectrum XSLT included is open source and available on GitHub for download. The Java-FX source code will be made available on request, but the emphasis is on the XSLT, not the GUI.</p>
<p>Also maintained by Phil Fearon: XMLQuire, an XML/XSLT editor for windows, PathEnq an online XPath 2.0 editor using Saxon-CE.</p>
